# DTCC SDR Data Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the DTCC Swap Data Repository (SDR) integration in the SwapPulse library, which will serve as a foundation for our DTCC SDR Analyzer application.

## Data Structure

### SDR Data Fields

Based on the SwapPulse library, DTCC SDR data includes the following key fields:

1. **Event timestamp**: When the trade event was reported (UTC datetime)
2. **Execution Timestamp**: When the trade was executed (UTC datetime)
3. **Effective Date**: Start date of the trade
4. **Expiration Date**: End date of the trade
5. **Notional amount-Leg 1**: Notional amount for the first leg
6. **Notional amount-Leg 2**: Notional amount for the second leg (if applicable)
7. **Spread-Leg 1**: Spread for the first leg
8. **Spread-Leg 2**: Spread for the second leg (if applicable)
9. **Strike Price**: For option-related trades
10. **Other payment amount**: Additional payments

Additional fields may include asset class, product type, and other trade-specific details.

## Data Fetching Process

### DTCC SDR Fetcher

The `DTCCFetcher` class in SwapPulse provides a comprehensive approach to fetching data from DTCC:

1. **Historical Data**: Fetches daily reports using `fetch_historical_reports()`
2. **Intraday Data**: Fetches intraday slices using `fetch_intraday_reports()`
3. **Combined Data**: `fetch_reports()` combines both historical and intraday data

The fetcher handles:
- HTTP requests with proper headers
- ZIP file extraction
- Data formatting and parsing
- Error handling and retries
- Rate limiting compliance

### Key Challenges

1. **Authentication and Headers**: 
   - The fetcher simulates a browser request with specific headers
   - It must be kept up-to-date with any changes to DTCC's API

2. **Handling Large Datasets**:
   - Data is fetched in batches to manage memory usage
   - Parallel processing is used for efficiency

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Date formatting and timezone handling
   - Field type consistency (e.g., converting string representations of numbers)

## Data Storage

SwapPulse stores DTCC SDR data in PostgreSQL with a simple schema:

- Table named based on agency and asset class (e.g., "CFTC-RATES")
- Raw columns preserved from the SDR data
- Timestamps preserved in UTC format

## Data Processing Workflow

The general workflow for handling DTCC SDR data is:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create database if it doesn't exist
   - Fetch historical data in batches
   - Process and store data

2. **Updating**:
   - Check latest timestamp in database
   - Fetch data since that timestamp
   - Process and append new data

3. **Scheduled Updates**:
   - Run update process at regular intervals
   - Handle any errors with retries

## Adaptation for Next.js

For our Next.js application, we need to adapt the SwapPulse approach:

1. **Server Components**:
   - Use Next.js API routes for data fetching
   - Implement efficient data caching strategies

2. **Database Integration**:
   - Use a PostgreSQL database for historical data
   - Implement efficient query patterns for fast retrieval

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Use WebSockets or polling for real-time data updates
   - Implement client-side caching for performance

## Performance Considerations

1. **Query Optimization**:
   - Index key fields like timestamps and trade types
   - Use materialized views for common queries

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache recent data in memory
   - Use Redis or similar for shared caching in multi-instance deployments

3. **Pagination and Filtering**:
   - Implement server-side pagination for large datasets
   - Provide efficient filtering capabilities

## Data Analysis Capabilities

Based on the user needs, our application should provide:

1. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Track trade volumes by product type, tenor, and time
   - Identify unusual volume patterns

2. **Market Structure**:
   - Analyze spread distributions
   - Identify market trends

3. **Trade Flow Visualization**:
   - Show trade flow over time
   - Highlight large trades

4. **Real-time Alerts**:
   - Notify users of significant trades
   - Highlight market anomalies
