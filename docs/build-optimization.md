# Build Optimization and Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix TypeScript errors and optimize the application for deployment on Vercel.

## Type Errors Fixed

1. **Type Compatibility in Analytics Dashboard**
   - Fixed null handling in the `AnalyticsDashboard` component by providing a default empty analytics object
   - Ensures the component always receives a valid `DTCCAnalytics` object

2. **Chart.js Type Issues in `TermStructureChart`**
   - Updated the chart data structure to use simple arrays instead of object arrays 
   - Fixed tooltip context parsing to handle the new data structure
   - Updated the `min` property to use `undefined` instead of `null`

3. **Agency and AssetClass Type Inconsistencies**
   - Replaced `AgencyType` and `AssetClassType` with `Agency` and `AssetClass` throughout code
   - Ensured type consistency in all files using these types

4. **DTCCHeaders Index Signature**
   - Added an index signature to `DTCCHeaders` interface for compatibility with Axios types
   - Allows headers to be passed to axios GET requests without type errors

5. **Cache Options Parameter**
   - Removed unsupported `persistToDisk` option from DTCCCache initialization

6. **Fixed Correlation Utilities Type Issues**
   - Added support for 'count' string literal type in correlation calculations
   - Updated function parameters to accept both keyof DTCCTrade and 'count'

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memory Usage Reduction**
   - Reduced mock data generation from larger datasets to 1000 records
   - Implemented chunked data processing (200 records per chunk)
   - Added cache management to prevent memory leaks

2. **Memoization Improvements**
   - Enhanced correlation calculation with memoization caching
   - Added cleanup logic for large cache collections

3. **Responsive UI Optimizations**
   - Improved canvas sizing for correlation heatmap
   - Added dynamic font sizing based on available space
   - Ensured tooltips stay within viewport bounds

## Deployment Configuration

1. **Next.js Configuration Updates**
   - Removed experimental.serverActions option (now default in Next.js 14+)
   - Updated configuration to align with latest Next.js standards

2. **Vercel-specific Changes**
   - Added vercel-build script to package.json
   - Reduced dataset sizes for memory-constrained serverless functions

## API Route Handling

- Addressed dynamic route warnings for API routes using query parameters
- These warnings are expected and don't affect functionality

## Next Steps

1. Push the changes to your GitHub repository
2. Deploy to Vercel using the Vercel CLI or GitHub integration
3. Verify the deployment is successful without build errors
4. Test the correlation analysis feature in the deployed environment
